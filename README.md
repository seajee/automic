# AutoMic

I've always had a problem with how Windows manages volumes for microphones, so i made a program that constantly sets the volume to a constant value so it never changes.

## Usage
```bash
Usage: automic <microphone name> <volume [0.0, 1.0]>
```

To have this program run at every boot there is a script that you can add in the startup directory.
You can find this directory with the "shell:startup" shortcut in the Run program.
